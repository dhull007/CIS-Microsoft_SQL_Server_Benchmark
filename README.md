# CIS-Microsoft_SQL_Server_Benchmark
A script to check the benchmark score of Microsoft SQL Server in regards to the CIS bench-marking guide.

#02022021 - PD - Got this script working on SQl 2019 version; it should be used as an algorithem templete instead of fix all code. 
#Its just technical refactoring to get it execute without errors.
